You can try to run our project by following the steps below, running in different environments may encounter various problems. We are still working hard to make it robust and bug-free. 
#### 1. Index your corpus via ColBERT
   Process your data into a format suitable for ColBERT indexing 
   ```
   python ColBERT/process_hotpotqa_wiki.py
   ```
   Indext your data
   ```
   python ColBERT/index.py
   ```
   Run the service for retrieval
   ```
   python ColBERT/server_retrieval.py
   ```
#### 2. Run the serive for verification and completion in Information Retrieval
```
python Server/server.py
```
#### 3. Construct Chain-of-Query and and interact with search service (communicate with Server/server.py)
